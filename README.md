# Holographic_shader
This is a shader that renders holographic projection effects on untextured models. 
The effects included so far are:
1. Flow animation of scan line
2. Edge light effect
3. Vertex failure effect
4. Fresnel reflection effect

In addition, the operation of normal extension is also written in the code, 
but because the effect in the actual operation does not reach the expected, so its transparency is set to 0, not displayed
